# Robin Rahman — Learning & Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal GitHub Pages site.

This repository is used to practice modern web development workflows and to document my learning journey as I transition into software development.

## What you'll find here
- Experiments with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Practice projects related to **Git & GitHub**
- Gradual progression toward **backend and C#/.NET development**
- Notes, demos, and small prototypes created while learning

## Purpose
This site is intentionally simple. Its goal is not to impress with design, but to clearly show:
- Consistent learning
- Clean Git practices
- Steady technical growth

Over time, this repository will evolve into a more complete portfolio.
